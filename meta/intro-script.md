Thanks for checking out HiiT Clock dot com!

My name is Chris Esplin.

I built HiiT Clock because I couldn't find a high-quality timer app for my workouts.

There are hundreds of timers online and on the app stores.

Most look terrible, don't have the right features...

...or are too low-effort to beat a simple stopwatch.

Two notable exceptions come from an excellent iOS developer named Daniel Wood of runloop dot com.

Daniel's apps are called HeavySet and Seconds Pro, and they're fantastic.

Be sure to check them out if you use an iPhone.

But if you're an Android and web enthusiast like me...

...you're stuck with HiiT Clock dot com.

I use HiiT Clock to create a personalized library of workout timers.

I need different timing schemes, with or without repetition.

I want to know which movement I'm supposed to be doing, as well as what's coming up next.

I want audio queues so that I can put my phone in my pocket...

...but I also want the option to cast my timer to my Chromecast-enabled TV.

I've been developing and using HiiT Clock dot com since 2017.

I use HiiT Clock during every workout, so about 10 times per week.

I use HiiT Clock with headphones and a television in my basement.

I cast my timer up to the TV while I listen to music on my headphones.

I can track my progress either on my phone or on the TV...

...and HiiT Clock beeps at me through my headphones at the end of every set.

HiiT Clock is a website, but it's meant to be installed to your phone's homescreen.

HiiT Clock dot com works great on your desktop web browser or on Android or iOS.

So give HiiT Clock a try!

You can select pre-made workouts, search for workouts shared by other users...

...and of course you can craft your own library of custom timers.

You can create workouts for friends or clients and share them with a URL.

I suggest adding hashtags to your workout timer descriptions to make them easily searchable.

HiiT Clock helps me be efficient at the gym, and I hope you like it as much as I do.

Send me email or Tweet at me.

I'm always open to feature requests and bug reports...

...and I love to hear how people use my apps.
