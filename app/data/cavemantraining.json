[{"name":"Caveman Fusion 4.5","description":"If you’re still working on technique then I suggest picking a light to medium weight and stick with that.\n\nIn this workout I started with 2 x 24kg first round, 2 x 20kg second and third round, 2 x 16kg for the rest of the rounds. \n\n#2 is just two reps, that’s all you should be able to do in one minute when you do it slow enough.\n\n#4 my stretches are hip and thoracic hyperextension into the pike and alternating pigeon stretch. This covers everything at the front and back, especially shoulders and glutes. \n\nhttps://www.cavemantraining.com/kettlebell-workouts/fusion4-5-kettlebell-workout/ \n\n#kettlebell #cavemantraining\n","tags":[".Default","Kettlebell","CavemanTraining"],"periods":[{"name":"Deep Squat & Push-up","totalSeconds":60,"type":"work"},{"name":"2 x Dead Clean & Alternating Reverse Lunge + Rest","totalSeconds":60,"type":"work"},{"name":"Clean & Jerk","totalSeconds":60,"type":"work"},{"name":"Stretching","totalSeconds":60,"type":"work"},{"name":"Rest","totalSeconds":30,"type":"rest"}],"__id":"caveman-fusion-4-5","uid":"shared-user"}]
