[{"name":"Caveman Fusion 4.5","description":"If you’re still working on technique then I suggest picking a light to medium weight and stick with that.\n\nIn this workout I started with 2 x 24kg first round, 2 x 20kg second and third round, 2 x 16kg for the rest of the rounds. \n\n#2 is just two reps, that’s all you should be able to do in one minute when you do it slow enough.\n\n#4 my stretches are hip and thoracic hyperextension into the pike and alternating pigeon stretch.
